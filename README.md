HOSTEL ROOM ALLOCATION SYSTEM
The Hostel Room Allocation System is a menu-driven program designed to help manage student hostel rooms efficiently.
It allows adding students, assigning rooms, checking availability, viewing allocations, searching records, and removing or updating them.
It allows the user to:
*Add a student with a room number
*View all allocated rooms
*Search for a student by room
*Remove (vacate) a room
*Update student details
*Save data to a file
This project demonstrates file handling, structures, arrays, and menu-driven program design in C.
